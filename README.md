# Data Analysis Course - Utah Valley University

This site serves as a repository for all class material.
The code and data we use in class will be posted here so you have access to it,
but all assignments will be turned in on Canvas.

The file *Course_Schedule.pdf* gives a tentative outline of the weekly topics to be covered, along with some snippets of example code.
